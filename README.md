# Purpose
This Capstone Project, completed as part of my Computer Science degree at WGU, involves analyzing and processing Formula One race data to train a hybrid neural network. The objective is to predict pit stops in real-time, aiming to assist with pit-stop strategy decisions.

# Contents
This project includes five main files and a folder containing raw data essential for the neural network's training and testing. Below is a summary of each file:

- **project.ipynb** - A Jupyter notebook containing all project code, with detailed comments explaining each process stage, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

- **Documents.pdf** - A collection of formal documents for a fictional company overseeing this project, including a letter of transmittal, a project proposal, and a post-implementation report. These documents provide insights into project objectives, development, and outcomes.

- **lstmhybrid.py** - The Python class defining the neural network architecture in PyTorch, specifically implementing the hybrid LSTM-FFNN model used to predict pit stop timing.

- **LSTM_hybrid_trained.pth** - The saved state file of the trained neural network, preserving the model's learned parameters and making it easy to reload for further testing or deployment.

- **processed_data.csv** - A CSV file containing the processed and cleaned data ready for model input, having undergone extensive filtering and transformation to retain only the most relevant information for accurate model training.

Each file has a specific role in the project, with in-depth code explanations in *project.ipynb* for transparency, while *Documents.pdf* details the project's analysis, results, and planning stages.
